## EDURange is an NSF-funded project with the aim of building cloud-based interactive security exercises.

This suite of exercises is intended to help supplement classroom lectures, labs, and other activities. Our goal in creating EDURange was to twofold. First, we want to reduce barriers to access by placing these exercises in the cloud (we currently host on Amazon EC2) so that all that students and professors need is a browser and a command line – no complicated virtual machine clients or plugins. Second, we wanted to build exercises that focus on highly interactive, competitive, and dynamic scenarios. We acknowledge that a number of instructors, both academic and industry, have created a lot of very good (and some not-so-good) exercises, training material, and lab manuals over the years. Kevin Du’s SEED manual is a fine example of intense effort poured into creating very good exercises over a number of years.
