## EDURange is an NSF-funded project with the aim of building cloud-based interactive security exercises.

This project consists of a suite of exercises to help supplement classroom lectures, labs, and other activities. 

We focus our development on two major goals:

### 1. Ease of use

We aim to reduce barriers by placing these exercises in the cloud (we currently host on Amazon EC2) so that students and professors only need a browser and a command line – no complicated virtual machine clients or plugins. 

### 2. Dynamic Interactivity

We build exercises that focus on highly interactive, competitive, and dynamic scenarios. We acknowledge that a number of instructors in both academia and industry have created a lot of very good (and some not-so-good) exercises, training material, and lab manuals over the years. Instead of teaching canned scenarios or simple examples, we're creating an environment where each run of the scenario is different. To help us keep this design focus, the key question we ask ourselves is: *what kind of analysis skill do we expect the students to acquire from running (and re-running) this scenario?*

***

As you can see, our central and very intense focus is on creating exercises that support and nurture the development of analysis skills rather than memorized scripts, recipes, or standard command line or GUI settings for a particular tool. We are inspired by the tenets of the [hacker curriculum](http://hackercurriculum.org), such as learning through failure modes and a purposeful cross-layer approach to topic introduction and exploration.

We want to create exercises that force students to think rather than just follow a script. We craft every scenario so that three or four approaches are valid, and students can re-run the scenario with the extra knowledge they’ve learned to have a totally different experience. Every scenario is live and dynamic — nothing is canned.
