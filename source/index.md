## EDURange is a platform of interactive computer security exercises.
<br />
This NSF-funded project aims to create a collection of exercises to help supplement classroom lectures, labs, and other activities. We believe that learning can be enhanced by an interactive and competitive environment. By practicing cybersecurity skills in a dynamic and customizable setting, students are rewarded by spending effort on thoughtful analysis, debugging, and reverse-engineering.

Our ultimate goal in this endeavour is to provide a publicly accessible environment with a minimal barrier to entry. EDURange helps students sharpen their information security analysis skills, while teaching them to evaluate and understand their limits.

### The research and development agenda focuses on investigating three core issues: 

1. The construction of a suite of cybersecurity scenarios. 

2. The deployment of this platform in a variety security testbeds and cloud environments (at no cost to students or instructors).

3. An understanding of how such scenarios might be used as an evaluation and assessment tool for both students in the course of their studies as well as an independent benchmark for other cybersecurity training curricula.

We believe the project has potential to significantly advance the integration of cybersecurity into the undergraduate computer science curriculum. By providing interactive, competitive exercises, it will enhance the quality of instructional material, increasing active learning for students. By making the program easy for the instructors to use, it will encourage them to integrate cybersecurity into the current core curriculum. These exercises provide rapid feedback to students and faculty, which will aid in assessment of student learning.
